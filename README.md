## FAQ

### **How does it work?**
CrosshairY renders a transparent, always-on-top window with a customizable crosshair graphic. It uses system-level rendering to overlay the crosshair without interacting with game files or memory.

### **Is it safe to use?**
Yes! CrosshairY is an external overlay that does **not** modify game files, access game memory, or require internet access. It’s safe for use in any game, including those with anti-cheat systems like VAC, EAC, etc..

### **System Requirements**
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit or 32-bit).
- Any game with fullscreen or windowed mode.

### **Can this be abused?**
CrosshairY only provides a visual overlay and does not offer unfair gameplay advantages beyond a custom crosshair. It’s designed for accessibility and convenience.
